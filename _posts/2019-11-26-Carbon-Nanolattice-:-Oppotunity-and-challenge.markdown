Carbon micro/nano lattices are a unique family of architected metamaterials constructed from micro/nano-scale carbon constituents [1]. During the past few years, they have demonstrated exciting potentials in reaching theoretical limits of mechanical performances as well as integrating properties which are often mutually exclusive through experimental studies and numerical simulations [2-8]. For example, the glassy carbon nano-honeycomb lattice fabricated through pyrolysis of polymeric microlattice has reached a compressive strength of 1.2 GPa at a density of  , approaching the lower bound of the theoretical limit set by the bulk glassy carbon [2]. Pyrolytic carbon nanolattices with topologies of octet- or iso-truss have been demonstrated to possess a combination of high specific strength, low density, extensive deformability and flaw tolerance, which are properties, in general, mutually exclusive in conventional materials [3]. The record-breaking performances of these carbon nanolattices are boosted by at least two factors: the size-dependent properties of the constituents and the well-designed lattice architecture [1]. By reducing the length scale of the components, such as beams or cell walls, to nanoscale, the constituents unlock the properties which are close to their theoretical values. For example, combining theoretical, computational and experimental studies [9-11], researchers have predicted that the critical size for pyrolytic carbon being flaw tolerant is about ~490 nm [3]. Experimental studies confirm that for carbon nanolattice with a characteristic length (diameters of the struts) below this size, local failure of the constituents becomes flaw insensitive, reaching the theoretical strength of bulk carbon materials [2, 3]. The benefit of being small is further coupled with the well-designed lattice architectures, resulting in richer and more balanced combinations of desired properties. For instance, via a systematic computational study of 3D graphene in the topologies of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs), it has been demonstrated that topology can strongly affect the elastic properties and failure mechanisms of graphene nanolattices [4, 5]. In short, the combination of small-scale carbon constituents and unlimited architecture designs of lattice opens a broad exploration space for better material properties in carbon nanolattices.

Besides pursuing high specific strength, ductility is also particularly important to carbon nanolattices for robust performances [7]. At the material level, the carbon constituents are intrinsically brittle. Including bulk glassy carbon [2, 6], the basic material building block of most carbon nanolattices is graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin layer of carbon atoms connected by sp2 hybrid covalent bonding [12]. As one of the strongest known materials, graphene has a theoretical strength of 130 GPa [13] (two orders larger than that of bulk glassy carbon, 2~3 GPa [2] ). However, experimental studies have unveiled that the fracture toughness of graphene is only  [14], which is close to that of an ideally brittle solid [15]. As the characteristic length of carbon nanolattices falls smaller to make use of the ultrahigh strength of graphene, it is also important to enhance the toughness and ductility of the nanolattices. At the structure level, buckling is an important mechanism to dissipate energy in nanolattice materials under compression [16-18]. However, permanent and continuous damage often accompanies buckling events. For example, it is observed that for hollow metallic and ceramic microlattices, the hysteresis loops of stress-strain curves shrink as the number of loading cycles increases, especially over the first few cycles [18, 19]. Also, while being accessible under compression [20, 21], buckling can have much limited effect on energy dissipation under tensile loading. For instance, MD simulations have demonstrated that under tension, graphene nanolattices, such as graphene gyroids, dissipate energy mainly through crack nucleation and propagation, which accumulates permanent damage and degrade the material systems [4, 5]. Given the great potentials of carbon nanomaterials, it is important to enrich the design library of carbon nanolattices with examples of novel energy dissipation mechanisms in order to overcome this challenge.

Like buckling, snap-through instability has been a long-time research topic [22-29]. Recent studies unveil some unique advantages of this instability. On one hand, at macro-scale, by carefully designing and arranging the snap-through units in metamaterials, sequential snap-through instabilities can be triggered under not only compressive but also tensile loading conditions [25, 28]. Cyclic loading tests demonstrate that these built-in instabilities suffer little irreversible damage [28]. Metamaterials with snap-through instability often exhibit multiple mechanically stable states, which open doors to the design of shape-reconfigurable materials (SRMs) [25]. On the other hand, at small scales, basic conceptual units with mechanically bi-stable states and snap-through instability [30-33] have been adopted to explain deformation behaviors of phase transforming materials, including structure proteins with compactly folded or unfolded domains [34, 35] and shape memory alloys undergoing martensitic phase transformation [36]. Such universal structure-to-property relationship indicates great potential in engineering complex overall deformation behavior via bi-stable units and snap-through instabilities.
