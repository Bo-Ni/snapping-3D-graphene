The present study is aimed to address the challenge of toughening carbon nanolattice with the potential of snap-through instability in engineering overall material behavior. Through mechanism-inspired structure design, MD simulations and theoretical analysis, we present a novel design of 3D graphene nanolattice with snap-through instability and demonstrate that it can effectively dissipate deformation energy without accumulating irreversible damages via pseudo plastic deformation.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
